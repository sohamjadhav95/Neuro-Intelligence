Pipeline for Handling Voice Commands with Dynamic Function Generation
This pipeline ensures smooth execution of user commands, handling both predefined and missing functions dynamically.

üìå Step-by-Step Pipeline
1Ô∏è‚É£ Voice Command Processing
Capture user voice input.
Convert speech to text using Whisper, Vosk, or any STT model.
Preprocess text (lowercasing, punctuation removal, etc.).
‚úÖ Output: "Open Chrome, search for toys, take a screenshot, and show it to me."

2Ô∏è‚É£ NLP-Based Command Parsing
Use FLAN-T5 or Llama models to extract command and arguments.
Convert command into a structured format.
‚úÖ Output (Structured JSON):

json
Copy
Edit
{
    "task": "Execute multi-step operation",
    "steps": [
        {"step": 1, "action": "open_application", "parameters": {"app": "chrome"}},
        {"step": 2, "action": "search_query", "parameters": {"query": "toys"}},
        {"step": 3, "action": "take_screenshot", "parameters": {}},
        {"step": 4, "action": "display_screenshot", "parameters": {}}
    ]
}
3Ô∏è‚É£ Execution Engine: Checking for Predefined Functions
Check if each action exists in the predefined function library.
If function exists ‚Üí Execute it.
If function is missing ‚Üí Proceed to dynamic generation.
‚úÖ If predefined functions exist, execute directly.

python
Copy
Edit
for task in task_list:
    action = task["action"]
    params = task["parameters"]

    if action in globals() and callable(globals()[action]):
        globals()[action](**params)  # Execute predefined function
    else:
        print(f"Warning: Function '{action}' is missing. Attempting to generate it...")
4Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic Function Generation (If Missing Function)
Call an API (LLM or Code Generator) to generate missing function dynamically.
Receive function code from API.
Execute exec(generated_code, globals()) to dynamically create function.
Run the generated function.
‚úÖ Example API Call & Execution

python
Copy
Edit
def generate_function(name):
    # Example API request (Modify based on actual API)
    generated_code = api_generate_function(name)  # Call API
    exec(generated_code, globals())  # Create function dynamically
    print(f"Function '{name}' has been dynamically generated.")

# Generate and execute function if missing
if action not in globals():
    generate_function(action)
    globals()[action](**params)  # Execute generated function
‚úÖ Example of API-Generated Code:

python
Copy
Edit
def take_screenshot():
    import pyautogui
    screenshot = pyautogui.screenshot()
    screenshot.save("screenshot.png")
    print("Screenshot saved.")
5Ô∏è‚É£ Execute All Steps & Monitor for Errors
Execute each function step by step.
If an error occurs, retry, generate missing functions, or alert the user.
Log execution results for debugging.
‚úÖ Final Execution:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
Executing: open_application(chrome)
Executing: search_query(toys)
Function 'take_screenshot' is missing. Attempting to generate it...
Function 'take_screenshot' has been dynamically generated.
Executing: take_screenshot()
Executing: display_screenshot()
üöÄ Final Pipeline Summary
1Ô∏è‚É£ Speech Recognition (Convert voice to text)
2Ô∏è‚É£ Command Parsing (Extract structured commands using NLP)
3Ô∏è‚É£ Execution Engine (Check predefined functions)
4Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic Function Generation (Generate missing functions in real-time)
5Ô∏è‚É£ Execute All Tasks (Run functions sequentially & monitor for errors)

üîπ Next Steps:
Do you want to connect a real API for function generation?
Do you need error handling and retries for robustness?
Would you like to log function execution results for debugging?
